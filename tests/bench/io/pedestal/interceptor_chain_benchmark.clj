;; Results
;;
;; These are informal results, collected on Howard's M1 Mac, YMMV.
;; Intent was to see if changes to the interceptor.chain namespace improved
;; performance. A lot of the code being tested is outside interceptor.chain however.
;; These numbers imply that even if interceptor chain processing was magically free,
;; it wouldn't affect request handling speed significantly.

;; Baseline:
;; /echo    94.08 µs
;; /fail    149.7 µs

;; Simple opts (only push to stack if :leave or :error)

;; /echo  89.3 µs
;; /fail  141.8 µs

;; After interceptor.chain rewrite:

;; /echo 53.8 µs
;; /fail 90.3 µs

;; Some further, minor optimizations:

;; /echo 52.6 µs
;; /fail 90.8 µs

;; Oct 30 - split invoke-interceptors and invoke-interceptors-only

;; /echo 51.8 µs
;; /fail 86.5 µs

;; Oct 31 - Back to (nearly) Square One
;; Reverted most changes to interceptor.chain namespace.

;; /echo 55.6 µs
;; /fail 93.2 µs
